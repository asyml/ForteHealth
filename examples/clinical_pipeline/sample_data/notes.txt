ADDENDUM:
RADIOLOGIC STUDIES: Radiologic studies also included a chest CT, which confirmed cavitary lesions in the left lung apex consistent with infectious process/tuberculosis.
This also moderate-sized left pleural effusion.
HEAD CT: Head CT showed no intracranial hemorrhage and no mass effect, but old infarction consistent with past medical history.
ABDOMINAL CT:  Abdominal CT showed no lesions of T10 and sacrum most likely secondary to steoporosis.
These can be followed by repeat imaging as an outpatient.
