Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, formerly known as juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), is the most common type of arthritis in children under the age of 16. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis can cause persistent joint pain, swelling and stiffness. Some children may experience symptoms for only a few months, while others have symptoms for many years.
