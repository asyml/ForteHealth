        This defines a basic config structure for `CoreferenceProcessor`.

        Following are the keys for this dictionary:
        - `entry_type`: Input entry type. You can change the context of
          coreference resolution by setting this parameter. For example,
          if you want to do coreference resolution within documents, set
          it to `"ft.onto.base_ontology.Document"`. If you want to do
          coreference resolution within sentences, set it to
          `"ft.onto.base_ontology.Sentence"`.
          Default: `"ft.onto.base_ontology.Document"`.
        - `mention_type`: The type of members in `CoreferenceGroup`.
          It can be set to `"ft.onto.base_ontology.EntityMention"` or
          its subclasses.
          Default: `"ftx.medical.clinical_ontology.MedicalEntityMention"`.
        - `lang`: The SpaCy pipeline to be used. The pipeline does the
          preprocessing steps for NeuralCoref.
          Default: `"en_core_web_sm"`.
        - `cfg_inference`: A dict containing the inference configs of
          NeuralCoref. See `get_default_cfg_inference` for default values, and see
          https://github.com/huggingface/neuralcoref/blob/master/README.md#parameters

        This defines the default inference config of NeuralCoref.

        Following are the keys for this dictionary:
        - `greedyness` (`float`): A number between 0 and 1 determining
           how greedy the model is about making coreference decisions
           (more greedy means more coreference links).
           Default: `0.5`.
        - `max_dist` (`int`): How many mentions back to look when
           considering possible antecedents of the current mention.
           Decreasing the value will cause the system to run faster
           but less accurately.
           Default: `50`.
        - `max_dist_match` (`int`): The system will consider linking
           the current mention
           to a preceding one further than max_dist away if they share
           a noun or proper noun. In this case, it looks max_dist_match
           away instead.
           Default: `500`.
        - `blacklist` (`bool`): Should the system resolve coreferences
           for pronouns in the following list: ["i", "me", "my", "you", "your"].
           Default `True`.
        - `conv_dict` (`dict(str, list(str))`): A conversion dictionary
           that you can use
           to replace the embeddings of rare words (keys) by an average
           of the embeddings of a list of common words (values).
           Ex: `conv_dict={"Angela": ["woman", "girl"]}`
           will help resolving coreferences for Angela by using the
           embeddings for the more common woman and girl instead of the
           embedding of Angela.
           This currently only works for single words (not for words groups).
